## Standardizing and harmonizing NGS analysis workflows

In this tutorial, we will explore how FAIR principles enable the standardization and harmonization of nf-core-based NGS analysis workflows within GHGA. We will then demonstrate the adaptability of nf-core workflows and discuss the importance of standardization of workflows. Finally, we will demonstrate how to make workflows scalable, robust, and automated for continuous benchmarks with hands-on exercises using a subset of a public dataset with a variety of configurations like local and cloud settings.

### Learning Objectives for Tutorial

- FAIR principles and their relevance for workflow standardization and harmonization
- The adaptability, portability and scalability of workflows within nf-core 
- Automating robust workflows to ensure reproducibility and highest quality of code

## An example benchmark analysis using NCBench and nf-core/sarek
