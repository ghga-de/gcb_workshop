## Standardizing and harmonizing NGS analysis workflows


In this tutorial, we will explore how FAIR principles enable the standardization and harmonization of nf-core-based NGS analysis workflows within GHGA. We will start with a short introduction of what GHGA is, its needs for harmonized workflows in the international context, and an overview of the FAIR data principles. We will then demonstrate the adaptability of nf-core workflows and discuss the importance of standardization of workflows. Finally, we will demonstrate how to make workflows scalable, robust, and automated for continuous benchmarks with hands-on exercises using a subset of a public dataset with a variety of configurations like local and cloud settings.

### Learning Objectives for Tutorial

- FAIR principles and their relevance for workflow standardization and harmonization
- The adaptability, portability and scalability of workflows within nf-core 
- Automating robust workflows to ensure reproducibility and highest quality of code
